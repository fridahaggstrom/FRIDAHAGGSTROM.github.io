            <p class="abouttext">This project is about creating a new typographic character that could translate the word silence.
              During my research I discovered that silence can mean a lot of things, both in philosophical and physical ways.
              I ended up asking myself what silence actually is. Does silence even exist?
              <br>
              As it turns out, the human ear can hear frequencies starting at 20Hz. I came to the conclusion that without sound there is no silence, and
              vice versa. The character I created is therefore sketched out of sound waves meeting each other at the lowest
              point.
          
              This is a sign for silence.</p>
