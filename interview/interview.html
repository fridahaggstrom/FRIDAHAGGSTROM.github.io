    <p class= "title">Carlota Guerrero</p>
    <p class="intro">Carlota Guerrero most notably broke onto the scene while collaborating
      with Solange for her 2016 album A Seat at the Table. After Solange's people
      reached out to her via Instagram, Guerrero captured the album cover and
      provided creative direction for the accompanying videos. Since then, she's
      most recently shot for Vogue Italia, Givenchy, and Dior. Based in Barcelona,
      the Spanish artist is known for her evocative, dreamy images in which she
      taps into the nature of humanity. She believes the common thread of her work
      is the "honest exploration of (her) obsessions: femininity, our wild side,
      disconnection from reality, dreams, mystical projections, the joy of being
      naked..." We chatted with the multi-talented artist about how she overcomes
      creative blocks, her favorite old films, and the voice she is nurturing.</p>

      <p class="milk">How has the art scene/community in Barcelona impacted your output of work?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">Paloma Wool, Olga de la Iglesia, Camila Falquez, Mau Morgo, Alejandra Smits,
      Maria Sosa, Xavier Marin, Marta Armengol… I've grown surrounded by friends
      that at the same time are artists that I deeply admire, and that has marked my
      way of creating very much. I think there is a specific way of creating in this
      city, the lack of resources or opportunities can be an incredibly creative scenario.
      For me everything started on the rocks by the sea of the Mediterranean, so in a way,
      I feel there is no separation between me and my surroundings…</p>
      <br>
      <p class="milk">How does your daily life mirror your artistic process?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">I like to think of life as an artistic project itself, everything can be a
      performance, every problem can be a space to get creative with new ways. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="milk">What do you do to remedy an artistic block?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">Dancing home alone, walking, crying, going to the sea…</p>

      <p class="milk">What's your favorite pastime outside of your career?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">Dancing and laughing.</p>
      <br>
        <p class="milk">What's the first thing you made that truthfully reflected your taste and ideas?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">A series of my friends naked on nature.</p>
      <br>
        <p class="milk">Your work celebrates the body, nature, and feministic qualities - what would you
      say is the common thread within your work?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">The common thread is that this is an honest exploration of my obsessions,
      and these happen to be femininity, our wild side, disconnection from reality,
      dreams, mystical projections, the joy of being naked…</p>
      <br>
        <p class="milk">In the past, you've collaborated with Solange + Rupi Kaur, two women with
      powerful voices, what are you trying to say as an artist? What do you feel the
      need to stand up for?</p>

      <p class="Carlota">I'm trying to give more voice to causes that I believe in, to bring images to
      the world that have some power and meaning. Power and meaning can be found in
      many ideas for me, from working more on representation and portray diversity,
      to express things honestly from my heart, from my own experiences.</p>

      for me to have strong emotional connections with my crews.</p>
      <br>
