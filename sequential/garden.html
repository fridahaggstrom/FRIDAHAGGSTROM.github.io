        <p class= "paragraf1">In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that
          <br>a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen
          <br>hundred artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled
          <br>for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments
          <br>that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance.
          <br>The following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun,
          <br>former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event.

          <br>spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office,
          <br>meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have
          <br>seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested
          <br>or murdered. Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable.
          <br>Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service
          <br>of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he
          <br>fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and
          <br>perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</p></div>
