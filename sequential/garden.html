        <p class= "paragraf1">In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that
          <br>a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen
          <br>hundred artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled
          <br>for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments
          <br>that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance.
          <br>The following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun,
          <br>former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event.
